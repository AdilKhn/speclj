To Run Specs:

Clojure: lein with-profile clj run -m speclj.main -c -b target/generated/spec/clj spec/clj
  -note: currently, clj specs will activate cljx compilation

ClojureScript: lein with-profile cljs compile

To Do:
-add to same jar
-re-add "spec" command
-test entire library on existing project


To Consider:

-can running_spec be added to cljx? current issue: clojurescript does not support "the-ns"
-can should= 3-arity delta version be tested in clojurescript?: current issue: clojurescript does not support "bigdec"
-can commented portions of should-thow (type) tests be added to clojurescript side? current issue:  clojurescript/javascript object types are dissimilar to java


(defmacro should=
  "Asserts that two forms evaluate to equal values, with the expected value as the first parameter."

  ([expected-form actual-form delta-form]
    `(let [expected# ~expected-form
           actual# ~actual-form
           delta# ~delta-form
           actual-delta# (abs (- expected# actual#))]
       (when (speclj.platform-macros/expected-larger-than-delta delta# actual-delta#)
         (-fail (str "Expected: " (-to-s expected#) speclj.platform/endl "     got: " (-to-s actual#) " (using delta: " delta# ")")))))
