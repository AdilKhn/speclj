To Run Specs:

Clojure: lein with-profile clj run -m speclj.main -c -b target/generated/spec/clj spec/clj
  -note: currently, clj specs will activate cljx compilation

ClojureScript: lein with-profile cljs compile

To Do:
-add to same jar
-re-add "spec" command
-test entire library on existing project


To Consider:
-can commented portions of should-thow (type) tests be added to clojurescript side? current issue:  clojurescript/javascript object types are dissimilar to java
